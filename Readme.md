This is one of my first projects using **PHP** and it is completely done by me.
It picks the information offered by Softonic's api and exposes the information retreived.
In this project **Smarty** framework was used, using the **MVC** pattern.
In /project/application/core/autoload.php can be found some **regular expressions** to determine which class should be load.
**Warning:*** The comments on the code and the output text are in Catalan.
